# Rag-with-Deepseek-from-huggingface
RAG System Powered by DeepSeek LLM Model from HuggingFace



This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to upload PDF documents, analyze their content, and engage with them through conversational queries. It uses Groq's LLM model (DeepSeek-R1 variant) to provide advanced natural language understanding and deliver precise answers. The backend incorporates FAISS for vector search and OpenAI embeddings to optimize similarity-based retrieval.
